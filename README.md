## Plain React
We need to store the userâ€™s info high enough in the tree that it can be passed down to the components that need it. In this case, the keeper of user info has to be `App`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Note
All the examples were taken from [Redux vs. The React Context API](https://daveceddia.com/context-api-vs-redux/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
