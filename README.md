## Children Pattern
Here’s a version of the React example where Nav, Body, and Sidebar accept children and render them as-is. This way, the user of the component doesn’t need to worry about passing down specific pieces of data that the component needs – the user can simply render what it needs to, in place, using the data it already has in scope. This example also shows how to use any prop to pass children.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Notes
All the examples were taken from [Redux vs. The React Context API](https://daveceddia.com/context-api-vs-redux/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
